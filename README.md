# GraphPeel

## Folders description

### 0_GenerazioneStrutture
Matlab codes used to define the geometries 
codici in Matlab per la costruzione delle strutture (layer di grafene, grafite e struttura per peeling= 

### 1_Layer_termalizzazione
Graphene thermalizing, using as the main LAMMPS code "relax_AC_Young.input"

### 2_misura_en_adesione
Thermalization of the structure with layers at different heights, used to evaluate the adhesion energy. The analysis is conducted using a Matlab code
:warning: According to Martina Azzolini, the code used here is completely different from the one used to write the manuscript. The final analysis was conducted using a python script which was lost

### 3_Codici_LAMMPS_percalcolatore
Input for the peeling simulation
